# xsnip - a minimal selection based screenshot utility for X11
Most screenshot utilities compatible with X are cumbersome, use bloated toolkits, and often do not support selection regions or the clipboard. 

xsnip has no external dependencies, is compatible with any window manager, has no graphical interface, has automatic clipboard support, and is entirely based on selection regions over specific windows.

## Usage
Click and drag anywhere on the screen to make a selection.

A selection made with the left mouse button will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

A selection made with the right mouse button will be saved under ~/Pictures by default.

It is recommended that you assign xsnip to a keybind in your window manager for convenient use.
